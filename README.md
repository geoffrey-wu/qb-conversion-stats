A program to create quizbowl conversion statistics from TJ sheets.

# TJ Sheets
 This program will only work for TJ sheets. You can take a look at them here: https://hsquizbowl.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=123&t=24390&p=383355

# How to Use
 Put all of the scoresheets (and no other files!) in the **Scoresheets** folder. At the top of the `stats.py` file, enter in which rounds from `starting_round` to `ending_round` you want to compile stats for, and then run `stats.py`.
 
 The output will be a single excel (.xlsx) file.
